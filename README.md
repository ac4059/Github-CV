 # Background

 I'm an alumnus of [Makers](https://makers.tech/) and a **full-stack Software Engineer**. Over the past 10 years, I have had the incredible fortune to live and work in three different countries(Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom). Most recently, I worked as a law clerk at Havkins Rosenfeld Ritzert and Varriale in New York City. Unbeknownst to me, my legal projects spawned an interest in software engineering that I elected to pursue more holistically at Makers Academy in London. I previously attended law school in New York City and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in History and Economics at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.

 # Skills
#### Technical flexibility

At Makers Academy I followed the TDD methodology, as well as XP values and agile processes. I

 My adaptability developed through working in a diverse range of industries which translated into developing projects in a range of different technologies, including **Ruby**, **Javascript** and **C#**. I have shown good practice when using TDD with an **external reviewer**, following a red-green-refactor cycle and making my code as clean and readable as possible. I've applied this flexibility to understanding different parts of the codebase to better understand the roles and reponsibilites of **our team** and allow better **delegation** of tasks.
