 # Background

 I'm an alumnus of [Makers](https://makers.tech/), and a **full-stack Software Engineer**. I have been fortunate to have had a vast array of experiences, having worked most recently within the legal industry, as a law clerk at Havkins Rosenfeld Ritzert and Varriale in New York City. My work within the legal sector enabled me to appreciate my own personal interest in technology. I previously attended law school in New York City and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in History and Economics from McGill University in Montreal, Canada.
