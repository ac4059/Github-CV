 # Background

 I'm an alumnus of [Makers](https://makers.tech/), and a **full-stack Software Engineer**.

 I have had the incredible fortune to live and work in three different countries(Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom) in the past 10 years. Most recently, I worked as a law clerk at Havkins Rosenfeld Ritzert and Varriale in New York City. My work within the legal sector enabled me to appreciate my own personal interest in technology. I previously attended law school in New York City and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in History and Economics from McGill University in Montreal, Canada.
