 # Background

 I'm an alumnus of [Makers](https://makers.tech/), and a **full-stack Software Engineer**.

 Over the past 10 years, I have had the incredible fortune to live and work in three different countries(Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom). Most recently, I worked as a law clerk at Havkins Rosenfeld Ritzert and Varriale in New York City. Unbeknownst to me, my legal projects spawned an interest in software engineer that I elected to pursue more holistically at Makers Academy in London. I previously attended law school in New York City and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in History and Economics at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.
