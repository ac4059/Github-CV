 # Motivation

“You have a speed limit, no more than 60 miles per hour. What if you had a car and a computer said that this car is not going to go faster than 60 miles per hour. It’s a different way of controlling behavior. Often by controlling our choices, code in our life exerts a more profound and regulatory effect.” – Tim Wu

Ever since I began to explore the impact of technology on social and public policy, I became drawn to coding. My previous legal studies enabled me to appreciate the omnipresence of code in all facets of life. Consequently, I enrolled at Makers Academy in London to foster my understanding of software development. Now, I thoroughly enjoy the wide range of tasks associated with software development and technology.


 # Background

 I'm an alumnus of [Makers](https://makers.tech/) and a **full-stack Software Engineer**. Over the past 10 years, I have had the incredible fortune to live and work in three different countries(Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom). Most recently, I worked as a law clerk at Havkins Rosenfeld Ritzert and Varriale in New York City. Unforeseeable to me, my legal projects spawned an interest in software engineering that I elected to pursue more holistically at Makers Academy in London. I previously attended law school in New York City and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in History and Economics at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.

 # Projects

 | Title | Description | Development Timeframe | Technologies Used | Test Suites/CIs/CDs Employed |
 |--|--|--|--|--|
 | [Route Around](https://github.com/Fantastic-Makers-Group-2-final-Project) | As a group of avid walkers, a 5-man team sought to develop an application, using JavaScript and React, that generated a random circular route when given either a postal code or the user's current location. | 2 weeks | JavaScript, React, Node, Google API | Jasmine, Jest, Travis CI, RSpec |
 | [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/ac4059/b_bikes) | A command line app that allows users to access bikes. This app was my first on-site project at Makers.

# Skills

  Technical Flexibility

  At Makers Academy my training consistently followed TDD methodology. Further, I actively aim to align my coding practices with Agile and XP values. My past experiences in other industries instilled a sense of malleability within me. In order to broaden my perspective, I learnt to write code in Ruby, JavaScript, and Python. Now, I've applied this flexibility to understanding different parts of the codebase to better comprehend the roles and responsibilities of our team and allow better delegation of tasks.

  Data Analysis

  Whilst developing digital marketing plans that predominantly involved data, predominantly in excel. I was tasked with the role of assessing the consumption of Bayern Munich's internet content. My role involved monitoring data and also evaluating subsequent marketing steps in order to further Bayern Munich's presence in the American digital realm.  

  Client Management

  I previously worked as a law clerk in a large-scale legal setting. My role had a prominent client-facing component, which involved intaking clients and considering their needs. This entailed listening to whatever facts they presented, taking stock of pertinent case-related intricacies, and helping to determine the best course of action to meet their needs.
